# Walrus Docker Deployment

This repository now includes a Docker-based deployment option that significantly speeds up CI/CD runs by pre-installing all the heavy dependencies.

## Overview

The Docker approach pre-installs:
- ✅ Rust & Cargo toolchain
- ✅ Sui CLI (compiled from source)
- ✅ Walrus CLI (both testnet and mainnet)
- ✅ Site-builder binaries (all network/architecture combinations)
- ✅ Node.js runtime and system dependencies

**Performance improvement: ~8-15 minutes saved per workflow run!**

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use the Docker-based Workflow (Recommended)

The Docker-based workflow is available at `.github/workflows/deploy-walrus-docker.yml`. 

To use it:
1. **Build the Docker image first** (one-time setup):
   - Push any change to `Dockerfile` to trigger the build
   - Or manually trigger the "Build Walrus Docker Image" workflow
   - Or run locally: `./build-docker.sh push`

2. **Switch to the Docker workflow**:
   - Rename your current workflow: `mv .github/workflows/deploy-walrus.yml .github/workflows/deploy-walrus-original.yml`
   - Rename the Docker workflow: `mv .github/workflows/deploy-walrus-docker.yml .github/workflows/deploy-walrus.yml`

3. **Deploy as usual** - everything else stays the same!

### Option 2: Local Development

Test the Docker image locally:

```bash
# Build the image
./build-docker.sh

# Test the environment
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace walrus-deployment:latest walrus-setup testnet

# Run a full deployment test (requires secrets)
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace \
  -e SUI_PRIVATE_KEY="your_base64_key" \
  -e SUI_ADDRESS="your_address" \
  walrus-deployment:latest
```

## How It Works

### Docker Image Build Process
1. **Base stage**: Installs system dependencies and Node.js
2. **Sui builder stage**: Compiles Sui CLI from source (takes longest)
3. **Final stage**: Installs Walrus CLI and downloads site-builder binaries
4. **Smart setup**: Creates `walrus-setup` script that handles network/architecture selection

### Workflow Changes
- **Before**: ~15-20 minutes (with all installations)
- **After**: ~3-5 minutes (just deployment logic)

The workflow now:
1. Uses the pre-built Docker container
2. Runs `walrus-setup $NETWORK` to prepare the right tools
3. Executes the same wallet setup and deployment logic
4. No more waiting for Rust/Sui/Walrus installations!

## Maintenance

### Updating Dependencies
The Docker image is automatically rebuilt:
- **Weekly** (every Monday) to get latest Sui/Walrus versions
- **On changes** to `Dockerfile`
- **Manually** via GitHub Actions workflow dispatch

### Customization
Edit the `Dockerfile` to:
- Change Node.js version
- Add additional tools
- Modify the build process

### Troubleshooting

**Image not found?**
Make sure the Docker image build workflow has run successfully. Check the "Build Walrus Docker Image" action.

**Architecture issues?**
The image supports both AMD64 and ARM64. The `walrus-setup` script automatically detects architecture.

**Want to use a different registry?**
Edit the `REGISTRY` and `IMAGE_NAME` variables in `.github/workflows/build-docker-image.yml`.

## Migration Guide

### From Original Workflow

1. **Keep your secrets**: No changes needed to `SUI_PRIVATE_KEY` and `SUI_ADDRESS`
2. **Keep your configs**: `config/walrus-client.yaml` and `config/walrus-site.yaml` work the same
3. **Update workflow**: Just switch to the Docker-based workflow file
4. **First run**: Trigger the Docker image build before deploying

### Rollback Plan
If you need to rollback:
```bash
mv .github/workflows/deploy-walrus.yml .github/workflows/deploy-walrus-docker.yml
mv .github/workflows/deploy-walrus-original.yml .github/workflows/deploy-walrus.yml
```

## Benefits Summary

✅ **8-15 minutes faster** deployments  
✅ **More reliable** (no network dependency failures during tool installation)  
✅ **Consistent environments** across all runs  
✅ **Easy maintenance** with automatic updates  
✅ **Local testing** capabilities  
✅ **Multi-architecture support** (AMD64 + ARM64)  

The original workflow remains available as a backup option.
